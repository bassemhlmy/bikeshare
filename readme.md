# **Explore US Bikeshare Data (Revision 2)**

## **Project Overview**

This project analyzes Bikeshare data from three major US cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. It demonstrates the use of Python programming, alongside the NumPy and Pandas libraries, to perform data analysis and provide meaningful insights into bikeshare usage.

The user can filter data based on city, month, and day to generate customized insights. A key feature of this project is the use of numeric inputs for city and time period selection, reducing the chance of user typing errors.

## **Key Features**

- **City, Month, and Day Filtering**: Select data using numeric inputs for accurate data analysis.
- **Statistics and Insights**: Compute various statistics such as the most popular travel times, stations, trip durations, and user statistics.
- **Interactive Data Display**: View raw data 5 rows at a time upon request, allowing for better data exploration.

## **Revision 2 Updates**

1. **Validation Function**: 
    - Added a new function to validate user inputs, ensuring they are correct.
